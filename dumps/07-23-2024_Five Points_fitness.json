The trainer turnover here is high and it creates to much inconsistency in routines. I'd recommend you hire a direct trainer and cut the gym owner business model out. I thought  it was a good idea but many of the trainers here are underpaid and they leave, which left me in limbo. Twice my trainer left and I had to reach out to ask for a new trainer. I had to, instead of being assigned one.  All of them have talked openly about the low wages. It was kind of disappointing to hear as a client. I felt bad for them regarding their pay but even worse when one told me they were 1099 employees. Just wow.",

Was then given another trainer who was on her way out the door. Then given another trainer who had Saturday availability only. Not a convenient time for me.",

I have really enjoyed the experience with my skilled friends, who are willing to reach me about runs, holds and footing. Movement's staff are always friendly, helpful, and instructional. I listened to one of the staff members assist a new member and they spent about 20 minutes together at a run talking through it with the instructor showing holds and footing. The runs are changed pretty regularly, so you'll never be bored. I've found the people who go to be really friendly and they'll give you tips, too, if you're open to it. I like the community vibe and the membership gives you access to multiple climbing gyms (in Denver and a few other locations).",

There was a ton of construction and no on-street parking despite circling multiple times. Because of the construction I could not figure out how to get into the garage.  I was really looking forward to a workout and did everything right. Yeah. But by the time I got into the garage and literally ran to the door I was  one minute late. They have a 3 minute policy and do not budge. I was greeted at the door by them cracking the door (Three of them standing at the door) to tell me sorry I was late and I couldn't come in and then shutting the door on me. I left my water bottle during my first trial class and didn't even have a chance to ask them if I could retrieve it. So I had no work out, I lost all of the money that I spent on the class and an additional $20 for no show. Classy. ",

                "review_text": "I've been taking indoor cycling classes at Viv for about 2 months now. They have been on my radar, but I was intimidated to try out a class after not taking a live, in-person cycling class for several years. I jumped at the opportunity to take a free class for new riders and am so glad I did. The coaches, staff, and fellow riders are all extremely friendly and helpful. While every cycling studio I've been to says you can take the class at your own pace, I love that the coaches actively encourage this during the ride as it makes me feel more comfortable/confident when I opt to take a fast song in the saddle. The energy is fantastic and I always leave feeling better than I did when I walked in. They also validate for parking in the Hub's garage, which is amazing since street parking can be tough when RiNo is busy in the evenings. If you've been thinking about trying Viv Cycle, I highly recommend you take the leap!",

The vibe right when you walk into their doors is absolutely electric. The instructors and front desk workers are so inviting and welcoming. The cycle classes are extremely upbeat and the music is great. This studio is 100% woman owned and a local business to Denver. I can't wait to come back and continue supporting this little (but mighty) business! ",

The studio itself is very clean and modern. There are plenty lockers with built in combination locks. The bathroom and shower area is beautiful and stocked with high end products. They have a great spin room with top of the line bikes as well as a stretch room where yoga, strength and Pilates classes are held. The spin classes are so fun with good music and high energy instructors. The class time flys by since it feels like you're at a dance party on a bike. Their unlimited membership has some great partnerships with other gyms so you can switch up your workout routine with Pilates and hiit classes in addition to spin. Highly recommend!",

It was super easy to get a day pass, and very inexpensive too (although you do need to visit during \"staffed\" hours as a drop-in). Their selection of equipment, while not perfect, was pretty good - they have a few barbells and squat racks, rowers, dumbbells, and a ton of machines. The gym was fairly crowded when I was there, so I did have to share and wait for equipment a few times, keep that in mind if you prefer not to share. There's a small outdoor section if you want to work out outdoors. All in all, a great drop-in option in Downtown Denver!",

New owners came in recently, and have done a great job of making the place what it was meant to be:  a bare-bones, unpretentious health club, with excellent equipment, very friendly staff, and awesome classes.   I agree that the Gauntlet class is an excellent all-around workout.  It will leave you spent, which is the idea!   One recommendation:  add another Gauntlet class on Tuesdays, so we can get that workout 2 x per week.   ",

The coaches are amazing. You never get the same workout and leave every time satisfied you were challenged. I reached a fitness plateau before coming here, but after a few months I noticed a lot of change in my body, energy and strength. Although the classes can have a number of individuals the coaches do a great job making sure everyone has great form. They have a couple different classes and each teacher has their own style. Check them out you won't regret it!",

Boot camp style classes,ex military coaches, reminiscent of Orange Theory where they utilize tread mills and then do some kind of weight combo and back to tread mill.  However, each class I go to is different which is awesome. There are group, partner, individual workouts depending on coach of the day. Great find and I highly recommend. Note : no barbell but still very challenging.",

They offer other programs like yoga and Level 10 which is a program that will test you physically and mentally. The thing I love about GenFit is that everyone is super-friendly and gets to know each other. The competition is fun and friendly and you will not find any douche-baggery here that you may experience at other gyms. ",

I got a gift certificate from a family member because I'm struggling with my cancer recovery and couldn't afford this on my own. I canceled my last class which was scheduled at 7am that day. Their policy is that the class has to canceled within 5 hours or you'll still be charged. I canceled 7 hours in advance. They refunded my gift card balance and then later charged my bank account for the class! I emailed them and even got a text confirming the cancelation and the time that was sent. In the beginning Shante was responding within 15 minutes to my emails. Told me I was charged because of the cancelation. After advising Shante that they were wrong in this, she has since refused to email me back. I have followed up twice over the past few days with no response, of course. ",

I've never seen a gym that has classes that are super focused on the barbell and heavy lifting (and no, BodyPump classes don't count!). I'm a strong believer in Emily's method and feel that it truly works (I mean, just look at her!). I currently live in the DTC area so I've only gotten to come to a few classes so far but I've loved every single one I've gone to. I always come out with some tips from the trainers, new moves, and feeling like I really pushed myself. I really wish I could come more often. The trainers are incredibly friendly and always ready with some tips to help improve your lifts. I have always weightlifted by myself with no trainer so I'm always happy to get improvement suggestions. This gym also makes barbell lifting feel very accessible to the \"everyday man/woman\". ",

They lift you up at your worst, celebrate your best, and bring an intimate sense of community to an often intimidating space. The gym itself is a gorgeous design and layout -- complete with a sauna, several Olympic lifting platforms, and even a weather-permitting rooftop for workouts and gatherings alike. Don't know the dog policy other than they're totally welcome inside if they aren't dicks! Grab some supplements, herbal tea bags, electrolytes, or swag on your way out...but y'all come back now.",

These women are amazing and most of them are moms which makes it just that much better. If you are looking for a tribe, it's here. If you're looking for a work out class that has babysitting, it's here. This is 50 minutes of intense workout that will get your butt into shape quickly all the while understanding that we are all busy! I am so happy I found such a great group to work out with!",

Each class I am dripping in sweat and pushing myself further, it's not easy but the best things in life never are! I've noticed that my strength and from in class is improving, not to mention my confidence has gotten a boost. HM is not just for physical strength and a cute booty, but also of mental and emotional. I'm so grateful to have found my way to their new studio a couple of months ago. It's always a bright a shiny part of my day when I get to workout with them. And the community of ladies who workout there are so humble and kind. Love all the in-store pop-ups and events the studio host too! Retail selection is always on point! Thank you Teddi & team for what you bring to class for each of us over and over!",

This gym has everything from specialty bars and equipment to mobility and rehab equipment. Love that it has a few garage doors that open to the street to give the gym an open air aspect.

I had very valuable stuff stolen from a managers office and was told this isn't the first time and they think it's someone who works for them? No action was taken on resolving the matter and management wanted nothing to do with moving forward. It is a complete chaos of a place and I suggest you do not get married there or it will all be thrown together the day of with no leadership.",

From my point of view this is an excellently well ran club. Membership director is approachable and on it, so is guest services as well as membership services. You have access to a brand new gym that is rarely crowded and over 200 reciprocal clubs. It doesn't get the love it deserves. Good people. Good fun, and if you get it, join",
