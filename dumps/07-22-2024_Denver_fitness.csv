I\'ve witnessed other guys bigger than me and lift more weight and they slam it down and harder than I do, so just be aware that some men will complain about you lifting some heavy weights! Another annoying thing is a lot of guys will put their bags/phone/water bottle/hoodies on this specific machine as if it\'s a locker of some sort, the nice rogue hyper reverse machine, as if it\'s not there for people to use? I\'ve had to use it while it had other people\'s sh** on it or if they\'re nearby I will ask them nicely to move it. I just thought that was funny to add in lol. The hours are limited, which sucks, it would be nice if it was 24hrs or had longer hours. BEWARE: No one ever wipes down equipment after they\'re done using it.
